# binary income classification :
build a model that predicts whether an individual makes over $50,000 per year based on anonymized census data
## Goal :
understanding factors influencing income inequality and potentially informing targeted social programs.
##  Data Cleaning or Refinement :
1- deals with Missing Values.
2- Figure out why the data is missing.
3- Eliminating all extra variables.
4- Eliminating duplicates.
5- detect and remove outliers (you can use box plot to ensure that your data have outliers).
6- Scaling and Normalization.
7- Eliminating blank spaces or missing information.(can use SimpleImputer to handle missing values).
8- Arranging the data logically and sequentially so that it is easy to visualize.
9- Grouping data in rows and columns or horizontally and vertically will help in data arrangement and
also proper visualization.
10- Dealing with Inconsistent Data Entry.
## Exploratory data analysis (EDA):
How is one variable related to the other?
What sort of relationship exists between two different variables?
What kind of trend is the data following?
Can a dataset be divided into smaller parts?
## Visualization:
used basic visualization methods using plottly and cufflinks not matplotlib and seaborn :
1- Line plots.
2- Area plots.
3- Histogram.
4- Bar charts.
5- Pie charts.
6- Box plots.
7- Scatter plots.
8- Bubble plots.
## Feature Engineering:
Dimensionality Reduction (PCA) / Encoding (1 Hot - Normal) / Scaling
## Build model:
7 Models:

Evaluation using different evaluation metrics like (Accuracy – Precision – Recall – ROC).
